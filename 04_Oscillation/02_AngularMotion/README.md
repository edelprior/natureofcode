### Sketch 32 :: Angles
#### Radians or Degrees, who wore it better?

Degrees = Radians in 'Real Life', they're the same thing just computers only understand degrees as radians.
Technically, a radian s a unit of measurement for angles defined by the ratio of the length of the arc of a circle to the radius, of said circle. But you don't need to remember that, that ```radians();``` will convert any angle thats in degrees, into radians.

#### Formula to remember, that will always save you
**Radians = 2*PI*(degrees/360)**

### The Sketch itself
It's common practice to start calling your Angular Velocity etc aVelocity, save getting confused in the future. This example rotates the shape using vectors created, and the function rotate(angle). It is important to use the Pop/Push method so that it rotates around the overall canvas.


#### So putting all these big Sciencey words into context :: Location is mucked about with by Velocity, and Velocity by Acceleration. And Acceleration is equal to Force.
