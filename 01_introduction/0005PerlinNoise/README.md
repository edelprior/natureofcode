## Perlin Noise
'Naturally ordered' randomness. It can be described as smooth.
```
noiseDetail()
```
changes octaves and importance of each other. Time and degree of incrementation are very important here.

#### Mapping Noise
``` 
Map()
```
takes five parameters * Value
                      * Current Min 
                      * Current Max
                      * New Min 
                      * New Max

Similar to scale function in D3.

#### 2 Dimensional Noise Pixel Arrays
Is on a grid rather than a path, smooth values on a plane of pixels.
So colours saved are individual - R values are: index [0], index [4]

Main Formula ::
```
(x + (y * width) * 4)
```
Pixel Density just resets all screen resolutions the same, it resets.
