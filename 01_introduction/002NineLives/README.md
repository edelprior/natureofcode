### Giving the DrunkMan new choices in life
There are now nine possible outcomes for where the man will end up moving. 
This is achieved by asking for a random number between -1 and 2. Apply this to X and Y.

```js 
var stepx = floor(random(-1,2)); 
```

### Probability
#### So originally, DrunkMan only had 4 choices, making each of them  a 25% chance. 
#### Now, he's got 9 choices, or a 11.1% chance of going a certain way.
