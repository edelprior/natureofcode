### Sketch 17 :: Lets simplify some code, for the craic
#### Vectors are what?
Its another way to store an (x, y) value. They're massively necessary and useful.
- Makes it easy to figure out the distance between two points (magnitude)
- Makes it more efficient in storing a location.


#### Different method of storing two vectors, called Position and Velocity
#### Position = location

**Velocity = Speed at which something is moving**

Using the following syntax, we get away with storing less variables in memory but achieving the same thing.
```position.x = position.x + velocity; ```
