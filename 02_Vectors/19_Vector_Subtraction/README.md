###Sketch 19 :: Vector Subtraction
####Vectors are what?
Its another way to store an (x, y) value. They're massively necessary and useful.
- Makes it easy to figure out the distance between two points (magnitude)
- Makes it more efficient in storing a location.


#### So how do we take two locations away from each other?

Subtracting two vectors, brings the object the opposite way, giving you the distance between them originally, and the magnitude.
``` var vectorLine = mouse.sub(center); ```

This takes the vector vectorLine away from the center point of the canvas.
