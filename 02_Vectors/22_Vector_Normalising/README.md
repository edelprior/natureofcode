### Sketch 22 :: Normalising these wild Vectors
#### Vectors are what?
Its another way to store an (x, y) value. They're massively necessary and useful.
- Makes it easy to figure out the distance between two points (magnitude)
- Makes it more efficient in storing a location.


#### Normalising = Standardising the Vector

A Standard vector (Unit Vector) always has a length of 1. After 
```js 
normalize();
```

a vector, it has the vectors direction only, and not it's length attatched to it.
Its readily accessible this way and can come in handy.
