###Sketch 23 PART 2 :: A constant Acceleration
####Vectors are what?
Its another way to store an (x, y) value. They're massively necessary and useful.
- Makes it easy to figure out the distance between two points (magnitude)
- Makes it more efficient in storing a location.


#### What is Acceleration (in this instance)
It is the **rate of change of velocity**
So to the code, we add a vector of acceleration, and add it to our velocity vector, to create a constant acceleration on screen ```this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);

```
