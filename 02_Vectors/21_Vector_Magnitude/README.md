### Sketch 21 :: Magnitude
#### Vectors are what?
Its another way to store an (x, y) value. They're massively necessary and useful.
- Makes it easy to figure out the distance between two points (magnitude)
- Makes it more efficient in storing a location.


#### Magnitude is a function in P5, fear not

Magnitude calculates the length of a vector. It is massively useful. Knowing this distance can help with the Multiplication and division functions.
It is achieved by the following piece of code;
 ```js 
var m = vectorLine.mag();

```
