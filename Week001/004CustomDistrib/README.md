### Gaussian Distribution

```nextGaussian(): ``` Gives a 'normal' distribution of random numbers with a mean of Zero and 
 a Standard Deviation of one. 
 It returns a double. 
 

#### Mean

The mean is the sum divided by the count, **the Average Number.** 

#### Standard Deviation 
Displays how much the rest of the numbers differ from the mean. E.G. 68% of our Population are within 170cm - 190cm
i.ie. The deviation is a distance of 20cm.
- ```randomGaussian() ``` generates a random number between 1 and 0 with a standard deviation of 1 and a mean of 0. 
This means, there is a 68% of the number returned being between -1 and 1.
