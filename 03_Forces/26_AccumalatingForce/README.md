### Sketch 26 :: Accumulating all the Force
#### So obviously in the real world there isn't just one magical Force
There are in  fact many different forces such as wind and gravity, affecting everything, all the time. So, being technical with Newtons wise words, it's all the forces of the world (or the screen) divided by mass that is equal to acceleration. So all our imaginary winds and gravities need to be added up.


### The Sketch itself
In Sketch 26, using an ```ApplyForce()``` and ```this.acceleration.add(force)``` means that all the forces that are applied to the object on the screen are added and can be described as the 'Net Force'.
 
#### So putting all these big Sciencey words into context :: Location is mucked about with by Velocity, and Velocity by Acceleration. And Acceleration is equal to Force.
