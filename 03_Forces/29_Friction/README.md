### Sketch 29 :: Friction
#### Is a Dissipative Force
All that big word means is that when an object is moving, the kinetic energy is converted into thermal, so the whole thing gradually decreases it's energy.
There's a big dirty formula but what's most important is that friction point in the opposite direction of velocity. Meaning we just get the velocity vector, normalize it and multiply it by -1.
- Magnitude in this instance is called the coefficient of Friction, which figures out the strength of the friction/Kinetic energy. Usually presented like this on a screen ```var c = 0.01 ```
- Normal Force which is the road pushing back against the car you're driving, or the wall you're pushing. Gets a bit mad with angles and trig later on, but for now the normal force is -1 aswell. so ```var normal = 1 ```

### The Sketch itself
The circles usually abandon a certain side of the window, this is due to the friction continuously pushing against the object in the opposite direction of its movement. This will be super handy with drag force in liquid.

#### So putting all these big Sciencey words into context :: Location is mucked about with by Velocity, and Velocity by Acceleration. And Acceleration is equal to Force.
