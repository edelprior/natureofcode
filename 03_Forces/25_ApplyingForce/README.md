### Sketch 25 :: Forces and the Laws of Motion
#### Who was this Newton fella?
Basically Newton understood the way everything (gravity etc) worked in the real world, and by translating it into the yummy digital world it means as follows:
#### - **The First Thing he said** An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion.
- An objects PVector velocity will remain constant if it is in a state of Equilibrium.
This means that if you set an object to have a specific velocity it will stay like that, forever unless "acted upon by an unbalanced force."


#### **The Third Thing he said** For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
This is your Mans third law, and the most important part of it is that it means Forces always come in pairs, the two area of exact equal strength, but in opposite directions... Think of pushing against a wall/ pushing against the system.


#### **The Second and most important Thing he said** Force equals mass * Acceleration
Think of this Acceleration malarkey in the sense of someone pushing against you, the harder they push, the faster you'll fall and embarrass yourself. But the fatter you are, the slower you'll fall. Silver Linings.
So as hard as someone pushes you, is directly proportional to how fast you'll fall, so it can be said, **Acceleration = Force**

### Lets put all these big Sciencey words into context
Location is mucked about with by Velocity, and Velocity by Acceleration. And Acceleration is equal to Force.
