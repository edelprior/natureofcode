### Sketch 28 :: That mind boggling Gravity stuff
#### Dropping two objects off a Building
This somewhat infamous piece of trivia has been floating round since the 1500s, but what the anecdotal scientific theory is trying to explain that the force of gravity is calculated relative to an objects mass, so the bigger the object the stronger the force, pulling it back from the ground. It's then canceled out when acceleration is divided by the mass (his second law).

### The Sketch itself
In Sketch 28, the movers graduate into an array of objects, and we make all our variables arguements passed through in a constructor, rather than hardcoded. 

#### So putting all these big Sciencey words into context :: Location is mucked about with by Velocity, and Velocity by Acceleration. And Acceleration is equal to Force.
