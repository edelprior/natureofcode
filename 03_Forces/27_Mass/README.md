### Sketch 27 :: Is there anything to be said for saying another Mass?

#### Simplifying things in the digital world

For mass to make any sense on a screen, a slight omission needs to be performed. Forgetting that size doesn't indicate mass, and lets pretend that the drawing of a circle visualises precisely its mass.

### The Sketch itself
In Sketch 27, using an ``` var f = p5.Vector.div(force, this.mass) ```
A new parameter is set up and used in the Mover class so each mover object created now has a defined mass, also determining the size of the mover.
 
#### So putting all these big Sciencey words into context :: Location is mucked about with by Velocity, and Velocity by Acceleration. And Acceleration is equal to Force.
